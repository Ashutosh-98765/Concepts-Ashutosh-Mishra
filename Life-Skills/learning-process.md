# Learning Process

## Feynman Technique:
The Feynman Technique is a method of learning by simplifying concepts and explaining them in your own words as if teaching someone else.

## What was the most interesting story or idea in the TED talk by Barbara Oakley?

One of the most interesting ideas in **Barbara Oakley's TED Talk, "Learning How to Learn",** is her explanation of how the brain switches between two modes when learning **: the focused mode and the diffuse mode.**

## What are active and diffused modes of thinking?

**Active (Focused) Mode:** This is the mode we typically use when we're actively concentrating on something, trying to solve a problem or understand new material. It's essential for understanding complex topics but can sometimes lead to getting "stuck" on a concept or idea.

**Diffuse Mode:** This mode occurs when we're not actively thinking about the problem, like when we're taking a break or doing something unrelated. It allows the brain to relax and make connections between different ideas, which can lead to creative insights and problem-solving breakthroughs.

## What are the steps to take when approaching a new topic?


* Deconstruct the skill into sub-skills.
* Learn enough to self-correct.
* Remove barriers to practice.
* Practice for at least 20 hours.

## What are some of the actions you can take going forward to improve your learning process?

To improve your learning process, you can take the following actions:
* **Set Clear Learning Goals:**
Define specific objectives for each study session or learning period. This keeps you focused and motivated.

* **Break Down Complex Topics:**
Divide large topics into smaller, more manageable chunks. Focus on understanding one piece at a time, which helps build a stronger overall grasp of the subject.

* **Use Active Recall:**
Test yourself on what youâ€™ve learned rather than just rereading notes. This helps reinforce the material and improve memory retention.

* **Incorporate Spaced Repetition:**
Review information over increasing intervals of time to prevent forgetting and strengthen long-term retention.

* **Alternate Between Focused and Diffuse Modes:**
Balance periods of intense focus with breaks where you allow your mind to rest and make connections. Using techniques like the Pomodoro method can help with this.

* **Practice Consistently:**
Create a regular learning schedule. Consistent, spaced-out practice over time leads to better results than cramming.
